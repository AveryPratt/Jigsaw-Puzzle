                <p id="aboutA">My name is  <span id="averp">Avery Pratt</span>. I started teaching myself C# .NET towards the end of 2015 with the hope of building projects related to astronomy and physics. After completing an app that can calculate the efficiency of rockets, I decided to attend Code Fellows in order to broaden my skillset and eventually become a professional programmer. My dream job is to work for a space agency to help humans get to Mars. I still have a long way to go.</p>
