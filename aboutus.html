                   <figcaption id="aboutA">My name is <span id="averp">Avery Pratt</span>. I started teaching myself C# .NET towards the end of 2015 with the hope of building projects related to astronomy and physics. After completing an app that can calculate the efficiency of rockets, I decided to attend Code Fellows in order to broaden my skillset and eventually become a professional programmer. My dream job is to work for a space agency to help humans get to Mars. I still have a long way to go.</figcaption>

After 3 years in Boston, I sold one of my startups and moved back to Texas before coming up to Seattle for work. Now I'm learning to develop at Codefellows and excited for what the future holds.</figcaption>
